# functions-explained

Before attending Prime Digital Academy, I had gone through the struggle of understanding anonymous and arrow functions, and I found that many resources online did a great job of explaining how they behaved in context. What they were lacked was an explanation of the relationship between each kind of functions.

I created this as a resources for my classmates and anyone else who wants to step through from the vanilla function declaration we all know and understand to the implicit return of an arrow function.
